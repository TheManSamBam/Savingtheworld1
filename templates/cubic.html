<div>A cubic equation is a polynomial equation of degree three, which means that the highest power of the variable is three. It has the general form:

ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0

where "a," "b," "c," and "d" are coefficients, and "x" is the variable.

Cubic equations can have one, two, or three real solutions, depending on the coefficients. Like quadratic equations, the solutions of a cubic equation can be found using the cubic formula or by factoring the equation.

Cubic equations arise naturally in many areas of mathematics and science, such as geometry, algebra, physics, and engineering. They are used to model various phenomena, such as the behavior of electric and magnetic fields, the movement of objects under gravity, and the dynamics of fluid flow.</div>
